This guide will help you get started with proper SAP installation on Linux.

## Motivation
We needed to install SAP on Linux and we wanted to document the process.  
Although there is a official linux version of the SAP GUI, it is completely different from the Windows version and it is not as user friendly.
We also had problems with the wireguard VPN only supporting one user at a time, so we had to use the SAPTUNNEL instead. Another reason for using it with Wine.

## Credits
- [Linus](https://github.com/critiqalfish) for finding out the whole solution
- [Simon](https://github.com/gamersi) for testing, polishing and creating this site
- [SAP](https://www.sap.com/) for creating the software

## Prerequisites
- A Linux installation (We used Arch Linux, this guide supports Arch, Debian/Ubuntu and Fedora)
- Internet connection
- Somewhere you can download the SAP GUI and SAPTUNNEL from
- A few MB of free space
- A bit of time (Wine dependencies can take a while to install)

## Installation Process
### Step 1: Install Wine
<Tabs syncKey="distro">
  <TabItem label="Arch Linux">
    ```bash
    sudo pacman -Sy wine winetricks --needed
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Debian/Ubuntu">
    ```bash
    sudo apt install wine winetricks
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Fedora">
    ```bash
    sudo dnf install wine winetricks
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Step 2: Create a 32-bit Wine prefix
```bash
WINEARCH=win32 wineboot
```

### Step 3: Install needed DLLs and switch wine to Windows 10 (it will be in Windows 7 by default)
```bash
winetricks -q vcrun2013 vb6run wsh57 ie8 mfc40 mfc42 dotnet40 gdiplus corefonts
```
This can take a while, so be patient. If it ever gets stuck, you can restart.  
If Archive.org gets DDOSed again, you are out of luck. *(That definitely didn't happen to us)*
and then run:
```bash
winetricks -q win10
```
You can use the `winecfg` command for that as well.

### Step 4: Download & Install SAPTUNNEL
```bash
wine saptunnel-setup.exe
```
Type in your name, email and the Zeebedee Key when asked.

### Step 5: Download & Install SAP GUI
```bash
wine sapgui-setup.exe
```
:::note[Info]
The installation will say it failed (with 4 errors), but that is just an error with links.  
The installation has actually succeeded.

### Step 6: Configure SAP GUI (Default theme may not work)
```bash
wine reg add "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SAP\General\Appearance" -v "SelectedTheme" -t REG_DWORD -d "0x00000100" -f
```
