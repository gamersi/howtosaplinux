import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

If you successfully [installed SAP&reg; on Linux](../installation/), this guide will help you start it.

## Launching
### Step 1: Create Launch Script (Courtesy of Linus)
```bash
#!/bin/bash

cd ~/.wine/drive_c/users/$USER/AppData/Roaming/Zebedee/
wine zebedee.exe -f client.zbd -d &
PID=$!
wine ~/.wine/drive_c/Program\ Files/SAP&reg;/FrontEnd/SAPGUI/saplogon.exe
kill -9 $PID
```
Write this to a file called `startsap` and make it executable with `chmod +x startsap`.

### Step 2: Launch SAP&reg;
```bash
./startsap
```

### Step 3 (Optional): Move the script to a more convenient location
```bash
sudo cp ./startsap /usr/local/bin/startsap
```

If you have done everything correctly, you should now be able to launch and use SAP&reg; on Linux. If you have any issues, please refer to the [installation guide](../installation/) or contact us via a [github issue](https://github.com/gamersi/howtosaplinux/issues/new/choose).
